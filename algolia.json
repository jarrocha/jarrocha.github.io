In other words, we present a prompt, the\nuser enters the commands, we parse the input , and execute it.

The man pages come real handy for this since\nwe have a very good reference just a terminal screen away. This program is\nconsidered a good start to learn the basic of system calls and signal processing.\nThis post serves as a quick analysis of the code in the\n\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003egithub repository\u003c!-- raw HTML omitted --\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Development","Linux"],"title":"Linux Shell Programming Basics","type":"post","url":"/post/2018-11-18-shell-prog-basics/","weight":0,"wordcount":364},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"search/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8946788897930c0c0c39fbfcd30ff2e4","permalink":"https://jarrocha.github.io/search/placeholder/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/search/placeholder/","section":"search","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"search","url":"/search/placeholder/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"top/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":300,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7a0da914bde98a7d3fcc7f6c5886633c","permalink":"https://jarrocha.github.io/top/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/top/about/","section":"top","summary":"About My name is Jaime Arrocha, I am an expericenced macOS and Linux system/kernel developer with interest in embedded systems, IoT, RTOS, computer networking, and cloud computing.
