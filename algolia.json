In other words, we present a prompt, the\nuser enters the commands, we parse the input , and execute it. Good error\nand signal handling is needed, as well as the return values of the different\nsystem calls that we will use. The man pages come real handy for this since\nwe have a very good reference just a terminal screen away. This program is\nconsidered a good start to learn the basic of system calls and signal processing.\nThis post serves as a quick analysis of the code in the\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/jarrocha/bschell\"\u003egithub repository\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Development","Linux"],"title":"Linux Shell Programming Basics","type":"post","url":"/post/2018-11-18-shell-prog-basics/","weight":0,"wordcount":883},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"search/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8946788897930c0c0c39fbfcd30ff2e4","permalink":"https://jarrocha.github.io/search/placeholder/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/search/placeholder/","section":"search","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"search","url":"/search/placeholder/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"top/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"html":null,"keywords":[],"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7a0da914bde98a7d3fcc7f6c5886633c","permalink":"https://jarrocha.github.io/top/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/top/about/","section":"top","summary":"Jaime Arrocha is an expericenced Linux developer with a passion for embedded systems, RTOS, computer networking, server applications, performance, and cloud computing.
