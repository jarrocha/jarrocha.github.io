      <description>Intro  In this post I will show the derivations of the equations to describe the behavior of a quadrotor. This is will be a 3-5 part series that will consist on dynamics, system simulation, control design with PID, control design with Optimal Control, EKF, and finally to see it on an actual quadrotor. This is based on what I learned from the Udacity Nanodegree course on quadrotor autopilot design with some further study on my own.</description>

      <title>Dynamic System Integration and Plotting with C&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>Intro  This is a quick demonstration on how to solve a state representation with the Euler method, collecting the values, and then plotting them.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t found a solution that wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy out there so I thought on getting the easy to integrate plotting library and a good math-algebra library to work with.
This is based on some work I did before with simulation. There&amp;rsquo;s some potential on expanding this, which I&amp;rsquo;ll do once I have more time.</description>
