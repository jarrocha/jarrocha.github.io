      <description>My name is Jaime Arrocha, I am an expericenced macOs and Linux system developer with interest in embedded systems, IoT, RTOS, computer networking and cloud computing. I created this website with the intent of both learning and giving back to the community. I hope that the information you find here is of help. I will try my best to keep the website alive with interesting posts.
There’s a chinese saying that goes “Don’t be fearful of a slow progress, be fearful of a standstill”.</description>
